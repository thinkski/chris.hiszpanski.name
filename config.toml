Most recently, I have been developing distributed and machine learning systems. At <a href=\"https://getkuna.com\">Kuna</a>, I created the computer vision platform for an internet-of-things camera network. Previously, I developed embedded systems. I created schematics, printed circuit board layouts, and firmware for a variety of devices, including three software-defined radios, a commercial drone autopilot, a voice-over-IP telephone, and a vehicle remote-control and tracking device."

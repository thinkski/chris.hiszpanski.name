Demo of cell microscopy using a convolutional neural network and serverless backend.

The image on the left is from a precancerous Papanicolaou test. Click on a cell in the image to evalute it. The first evalution may take a couple seconds longer as the backend warms up.

How to identify an abnormal cell? Look for rings around the nucleus, multiple nuclei, or grossly enlarged nuclei. Be sure the nuclei are not actually normal parts of two overlapping cells. Hint: See two green cells near the center.
